## Appendix 1: GSODR Final Data Format, Contents and Units

_GSODR_ formatted data include the following fields and units:

- **STNID** - Station number (WMO/DATSAV3 number) for the location;

- **NAME** - Unique text identifier;

- **CTRY** - Country in which the station is located. This field is the original FIPS code that NCEI provides;

- **COUNTRY_NAME** - Country in which the station is located. This field is the country name in English language;

- **ISO2C** - Country in which the station is located. This field is the two letter ISO country code;

- **ISO3C** - Country in which the station is located. This field is the three letter ISO country code;

- **LAT** - Latitude. *Station dropped in cases where values are < -90 or > 90 degrees or Lat = 0 and Lon = 0*;

- **LON** - Longitude. *Station dropped in cases where values are < -180 or > 180 degrees or Lat = 0 and Lon = 0*;

- **ELEVATION** - Elevation in metres;

- **YEARMODA** - Date in YYYYMMDD format;

- **YEAR** - The year (YYYY);

- **MONTH** - The month (mm);

- **DAY** - The day (dd);

- **YDAY** - Sequential day of year (not in original GSOD);

- **TEMP** - Mean daily temperature converted to degrees C to tenths.
Missing = `NA`;

- **TEMP\_ATTRIBUTES** - Number of observations used in calculating mean daily temperature;

- **DEWP** - Mean daily dew point converted to degrees C to tenths.
Missing = `NA`;

- **DEWP\_ATTRIBUTES** - Number of observations used in calculating mean daily dew point;

- **SLP** - Mean sea level pressure in millibars to tenths.
Missing = `NA`;

- **SLP\_ATTRIBUTES** - Number of observations used in calculating mean sea level pressure;

- **STP** - Mean station pressure for the day in millibars to tenths.
Missing = `NA`;

- **STP\_ATTRIBUTES** - Number of observations used in calculating mean station pressure;

- **VISIB** - Mean visibility for the day converted to kilometres to tenths.
Missing = `NA`;

- **VISIB\_ATTRIBUTES** - Number of observations used in calculating mean daily visibility;

- **WDSP** - Mean daily wind speed value converted to metres/second to tenths.
Missing = `NA`;

- **WDSP\_ATTRIBUTES** - Number of observations used in calculating mean daily wind speed;

- **MXSPD** - Maximum sustained wind speed reported for the day converted to metres/second to tenths.
Missing = `NA`;

- **GUST** - Maximum wind gust reported for the day converted to metres/second to tenths.
Missing = `NA`;

- **MAX** - Maximum temperature reported during the day converted to Celsius to tenths--time of max temp report varies by country and region, so this will sometimes not be the max for the calendar day.
Missing = `NA`;

- **MAX\_ATTRIBUTES** - Blank indicates max temp was taken from the explicit max temp report and not from the 'hourly' data.
An "\*" indicates max temp was derived from the hourly data (_i.e._, highest hourly or synoptic-reported temperature);

- **MIN** - Minimum temperature reported during the day converted to Celsius to tenths--time of min temp report varies by country and region, so this will sometimes not be the max for the calendar day.
Missing = `NA`;

- **MIN\_ATTRIBUTES** - Blank indicates max temp was taken from the explicit min temp report and not from the 'hourly' data.
An "\*" indicates min temp was derived from the hourly data (_i.e._, highest hourly or synoptic-reported temperature);

- **PRCP** - Total precipitation (rain and/or melted snow) reported during the day converted to millimetres to hundredths; will usually not end with the midnight observation, _i.e._, may include latter part of previous day.
A value of ".00" indicates no measurable precipitation (includes a trace).
Missing = NA;
*Note: Many stations do not report '0' on days with no precipitation-- therefore, `NA` will often appear on these days.
For example, a station may only report a 6-hour amount for the period during which rain fell.*
See `FLAGS_PRCP` column for source of data;

- **PRCP\_ATTRIBUTES** -

    - A = 1 report of 6-hour precipitation amount;

    - B = Summation of 2 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;

    - C = Summation of 3 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;

    - D = Summation of 4 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;

    - E = 1 report of 12-hour precipitation amount;

    - F = Summation of 2 reports of 12-hour precipitation amount;

    - G = 1 report of 24-hour precipitation amount;

    - H = Station reported '0' as the amount for the day (*e.g.* from 6-hour reports), but also reported at least one occurrence of precipitation in hourly observations--this could indicate a trace occurred, but should be considered as incomplete data for the day;

    - I = Station did not report any precipitation data for the day and did not report any occurrences of precipitation in its hourly observations--it's still possible that precipitation occurred but was not reported;

- **SNDP** - Snow depth in millimetres to tenths.
Missing = `NA`;

- **I\_FOG** - Indicator for fog, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the occurrence during the day;

- **I\_RAIN\_DRIZZLE** - Indicator for rain or drizzle, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the occurrence during the day;

- **I\_SNOW\_ICE** - Indicator for snow or ice pellets, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the occurrence during the day;

- **I\_HAIL** - Indicator for hail, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the occurrence during the day;

- **I\_THUNDER** - Indicator for thunder, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the occurrence during the day;

- **I_TORNADO_FUNNEL** - Indicator for tornado or funnel cloud, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the occurrence during the day;

- **EA** - Mean daily actual vapour pressure as calculated using improved August-Roche-Magnus approximation [@Alduchov1996]. Missing = `NA`;

- **ES** - Mean daily saturation vapour pressure as calculated using improved August-Roche-Magnus approximation [@Alduchov1996]. Missing = `NA`;

- **RH** - Mean daily relative humidity as calculated using improved August-Roche-Magnus approximation [@Alduchov1996].
Missing = `NA`.
