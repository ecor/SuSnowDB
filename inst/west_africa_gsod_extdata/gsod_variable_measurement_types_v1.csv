STP,Mean station pressure for the day in millibars to tenths. Missing = `NA`; FLAGS_STP: Number of observations used in calculating mean station pressure;,daily,See Description,,TRUE
VISIB,Mean visibility for the day converted to kilometres to tenths. Missing = `NA`; FLAGS_VISIB: Number of observations used in calculating mean daily visibility;,daily,See Description,,TRUE
WDSP,Mean daily wind speed value converted to metres/second to tenths. Missing = `NA`; FLAGS_WDSP: Number of observations used in calculating mean daily wind speed;,daily,See Description,,TRUE
MXSPD,Maximum sustained wind speed reported for the day converted to metres/second to tenths. Missing = `NA`;,daily,See Description,,FALSE
GUST,Maximum wind gust reported for the day converted to metres/second to tenths. Missing = `NA`;,daily,See Description,,FALSE
MAX,"Maximum temperature reported during the day converted to Celsius to tenths--time of max temp report varies by country and region, so this will sometimes not be the max for the calendar day. Missing = `NA`; FLAGS_MAX: Blank indicates max temp was taken from the explicit max temp report and not from the 'hourly' data. An ""\*"" indicates max temp was derived from the hourly data (_i.e._, highest hourly or synoptic-reported temperature);",daily,See Description,,TRUE
MIN,"Minimum temperature reported during the day converted to Celsius to tenths--time of min temp report varies by country and region, so this will sometimes not be the max for the calendar day. Missing = `NA`; FLAGS_MIN: Blank indicates max temp was taken from the explicit min temp report and not from the 'hourly' data. An ""\*"" indicates min temp was derived from the hourly data (_i.e._, highest hourly or synoptic-reported temperature);",daily,See Description,,TRUE
PRCP,"Total precipitation (rain and/or melted snow) reported during the day converted to millimetres to hundredths; will usually not end with the midnight observation, _i.e._, may include latter part of previous day. A value of "".00"" indicates no measurable precipitation (includes a trace). Missing = NA; *Note: Many stations do not report '0' on days with no precipitation-- therefore, `NA` will often appear on these days. For example, a station may only report a 6-hour amount for the period during which rain fell.* See `FLAGS_PRCP` column for source of data; FLAGS_PRCP: A = 1 report of 6-hour precipitation amount;     B = Summation of 2 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;     C = Summation of 3 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;     D = Summation of 4 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;     E = 1 report of 12-hour precipitation amount;     F = Summation of 2 reports of 12-hour precipitation amount;     G = 1 report of 24-hour precipitation amount;     H = Station reported '0' as the amount for the day (*e.g.* from 6-hour reports), but also reported at least one occurrence of precipitation in hourly observations--this could indicate a trace occurred, but should be considered as incomplete data for the day;     I = Station did not report any precipitation data for the day and did not report any occurrences of precipitation in its hourly observations--it's still possible that precipitation occurred but was not reported;",daily,See Description,,TRUE

I_SNOW_ICE,"Indicator for snow or ice pellets, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the occurrence during the day;",daily,See Description,,FALSE
